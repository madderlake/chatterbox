This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation
After cloning the repo (from root directory):
  1. `npm install`
  2. `npm start` - will start dev server and socket server
  

### Overview
This is a basic chat app with websockets. I wanted to play around with sockets for real-time functionality, and router, so I could have the beginnings of an auth system. No need to burden you with logins and passwords at this point though, right?


### ToDo - Add more features
  1.~Implement Redux or Local Storage~\
  2. Implement Auth system\
  3. ~Channels and topics~\
  4. ~"Somebody is typing..."~\
  5. ~Switch Rooms (channels)~
